##### PURPOSE #####
	The basic purpose of this hack (app) is to upload your 
		desired to your your desired path on your website.
	I made this because ftp is not working in my college. So this do not use any file transfer protocol.
	It just need to be uploaded once in your website.
	Then it will upload your file anywhere you want in your website directories.
	You can also create directiories (folder) to upload a file in new folder.
	It means it just needs one time upload.
